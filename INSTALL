step 1: Copy tranlater directory to your project dir, or add to PYTHON_PATH
step 2: Add 'translater' into settings.INSTALLED_APPS
step 3: run syncdb

How to use:

After installed, put into your templates file:

{% load translator %}

to translate any string use:

{{"Please, translate me from database..."|TranslateMe:"pt-br"}}


if, string "Please, translate me from database..." already translated to pt-br,  template show it, otherwise, return original string, and save the original string into database to translate after...

of course, we can use it with any django variables:


{% load translator %}
<html>

<head><title>my theme</title>
</head>
<body>
{%if article%}

{{ article.title|TranslateMe:LANGUAGE_CODE}}

{%endif%}
</body>
</html>




open /admin/translater/ to add/edit strings...
